# Animation Looping

This repo contains the source code for all the demos from [this article](https://theorangeduck.com/page/looping-animations-motion-capture).

It uses [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) or more specifically [raygui](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui) so if you have that installed it should be easy to play around and out.
